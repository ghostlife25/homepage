	    Issue 2 of ghostlife will go live on October 7th and added onto until 21st of October. So from today on until the 20th of October we accept your submissions! You can host your <strong>static</strong> webpage wherever you like (neocities or github for example). It should <strong>not</strong> be your homepage, but a webpage in it's own folder. www.example.com/ghostlife002/ == this folder should contain all contents your webpage needs. Please do not embed external content as this might cause the page to break at some point. After publishing it in the ghostlife zine the webpage should not be edited anymore.

    To submit please send us an email with the link to your submission: <br> october25 [at] ghostlife [dot] org <br> please include your (artist)name and how you found this webpage (if you want - we're curious)
