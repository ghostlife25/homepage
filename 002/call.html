	<p><strong>ghostlife.org</strong> is an experiment in decentralized communal publishing. Its aim is to be a prototype for distributing information together with others, forming a community independent of any centralized platform. <br>It functions by joining together self-contained webpages into a webring each month. These webpages are not meant to be changed after publication. Being composed of individual, static files hosted on different servers means the construct can be decentralized and is possibly nomadic. These factors, along with the technical simplicity, could make this an easy and resilient mode of digital publishing.</p>

  <p>There is no term yet for a self-contained webpage, so we propose the word <strong>webleaf*</strong>.</p>

  <p>So, ghostlife.org is a webring of webleaves.</p>

  <h3>How to apply:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a webpage with any static site generator or by writing HTML.</li>
    <li>Convert the webpage to a single HTML file using the free and open-source browser extension <a href="https://www.getsinglefile.com/" target="_blank">SingleFile</a>. Now all media and stylesheets are encoded as one .html file. It is now a webleaf.</li>
    <li>Add the code snippet found on our <a href="https://www.ghostlife.org/002/copythis.txt">website</a> and adjust the colors of the widget to your liking.</li>
    <li>Upload your webleaf (for example, on Neocities, GitHub Pages, or your own server).</li>
    <li>Send us an email with the link to your leaf, how you’d like to be referred to, and how you found this open call.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Rules:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The webleaf should be smaller than 5 MB.</li>
    <li>No hate speech, discriminatory language, or misinformation.</li>
    <li>No links to social media or for-profit platforms.</li>
    <li>Please refrain from sharing or mentioning ghostlife.org on social media or other for-profit platforms.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>*The word works in three ways:<br>
  1 A hypertext document is referred to as a webpage. This is a bookbinding metaphor— in bookbinding, a page is printed onto a leaf.<br>
  2 In computer science, a data structure is described as a tree; a single file is called a leaf node.<br>
  3 The leaflet was the first medium for mass communication. Also called a pamphlet or flyer, single sheets of paper with information have been ubiquitous since the invention of the printing press. As of today, there is no agreed-upon digital equivalent of the printed leaflet.</p>

  <p id="lastP"><strong>Deadline:</strong> the open call is ongoing and has no deadline. Each ring consists of leaves published in one month. So send your submissions to: [thismonth]@ghostlife.org
