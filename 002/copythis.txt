please copy the following block of code and paste it in the webpage you'd like
to be added to ghostlife 001.
place it right above the </body> tag of your .html file, 
nothing should be between the last line of the code block and the </body> tag 
after you've done this reach out and let me know. Then I'll add your webpage
to the hyperloop :D




<div id='ghostlife002'>
  <script>
//replace the values between the quotation marks above to change the colors

   let linkTextColor = "#808eff";
   let ghostLifeTextColor = "#ffffff";
